# Get2gether
As a team, we struggled to find appropriate meeting times that would cater to each member. We needed an application that could organize both individual and group schedules like school work, upcoming exams, work schedules, social  events (i.e. a family memberâ€™s birthday party), and any personal tasks (i.e. Dentist appointments) that we may have. The solution to our problem was Get2gether.

Get2gether is an application that acts as a personal secretary in which it helps the user plan schedules, organize tasks/reminders, and keep track of their work. The application uses tools such as a chat, a calendar, and a meeting scheduler as well as reminder notifications to help manage their personal schedules.
