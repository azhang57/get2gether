### Background
As a team, we struggled to find appropriate meeting times that would cater to each member. We needed an application that could organize both individual and group schedules like school work, upcoming exams, work schedules, social  events (i.e. a family member’s birthday party), and any personal tasks (i.e. Dentist appointments) that we may have. The solution to our problem was Get2gether.

Get2gether is an application that acts as a personal secretary in which it helps the user plan schedules, organize tasks/reminders, and keep track of their work. The application uses tools such as a chat, a calendar, and a meeting scheduler as well as reminder notifications to help manage their personal schedules. 

### Functionality
- Users can create their own account and login
- Users can create, edit, and delete personal events
- Users can create groups and add members to the group.
- Groups can keep track of group events via the Group Calendar
- Any group member within a group can edit, create, and delete his/her associated group
- Group members can instant message one another via the Discussion Board located in the Group Calendar view
- Reminders are provided to the user of upcoming events within the current week
